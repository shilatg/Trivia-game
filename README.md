Full Stack UI Project:
The project is a digital store application that provides a dynamic shopping experience. The project performs the following operations:

Personalized User Experience:

The user can choose between a light and dark display theme (Light/Dark Mode).
The project saves the user's preferences regarding the display theme using the Context API.

The system records the quantity and final price of each item in the cart and provides a price summary.
Interfacing with MobX to manage the states of items in the cart.
Buttons for interacting with the items in the cart, including adding/removing items.
Payment System:

Users can enter credit card information in a simple way to proceed to payment.
Includes a payment interface that includes fields for entering credit card information and expiration date.
Interactive Product Gallery:

Display products using a pop-up with the option to switch between product images.
The user can navigate between the images using arrows.
Intuitive navigation:

A clear and accessible navigation system between different pages of the site, including the home page, store page, shopping cart, and more.
Users can easily navigate between the different pages of the site using buttons in the main menu.
User management:

The system identifies the user and allows him to go to the login page conveniently.
The user's name can be displayed in a personalized greeting on the site pages.
Technologies I used:
React – for building the interface and the behavior of the pages.
React Router – for managing the navigation between the pages.
MobX – for managing the states and state of the shopping cart.
Context API – for managing user preferences (for example: the display mode).
CSS – for designing and visual enjoyment of the interface.
